**Feel free to contribute! I don't scrapp anymore nor work in 'IT' community. There isn't GUI, so it will be nice if someone do it.**

Hello dear scrappers!
With this repository, you can scrape all the sites that match your search in DuckDuckGo. 
The operation of the program is based on the Tor browser.
Thus, you do not need to buy a proxy.
Yes, no proxy. Null.
Tor provides full anonymity, so you don't have to worry about legal consequences.

Requirements:
Tor Browser
Firefox
Gecko Driver

Optional:
Vpn - I know this isn't needed when using Tor, but mass scraping of a site, especially a popular one, may interest some people.
A cheap and secure option is Mullvad - kill switch, no logs, Multihop, Quantum-resistant tunnels, DAITA. Other providers are also ok.
No, I did not receive a cent for this 'advertisement'.

How to use the program?
1. Install both files and download with PIP everything from line 3-12
2. Configure Spider.
3. In the file 'Mr_Magic.py' replace 'example.com' with the site you want to scrapp.
4. In the folder where you downloaded both files, type CMD in path.
5. Type: python Mr_Magic.py
6. Complete everything according to the instructions you will see.
7. Once completed and approved, the program will start scraping.
8. The results will be saved in the file results.json
9. Voila!
